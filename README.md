# TappyPlane
A game about a plane and... you tap the screen with "Spacebar" and make it fly between the pipes to score points.
// Simple knock-off of Flappy Bird and part of a learning course for game development in Godot. //

I DO NOT OWN THE ART, THE ASSETS OR THE GAME IDEA ITSELF.
Game originally created by Richard Allbert on a Udemy course.
